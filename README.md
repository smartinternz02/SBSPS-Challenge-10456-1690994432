Project Title: Analyzing Agriculture in India and making strategic decisions based on it according to population

This project focuses on analyzing agricultural data to aid decision-making in crop production. It merges datasets on crop yield, rainfall, and soil erosion, offering insights into crop patterns and climate influences. Through interactive visualizations created with Python's geospatial libraries and IBM Cognos, the project aims to assist planners, policymakers, and farmers. The web-based dashboard presents key findings, such as commonly grown crops and the impact of rainfall and erosion on production. The project's advantage lies in informed resource allocation and risk assessment, though data limitations and dynamic factors must be considered. The project holds potential for future enhancements, including predictive models and real-time data integration, to further improve agricultural practices.
